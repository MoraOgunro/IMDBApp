# IMDBApp
An Android application that displays a TV showâ€™s IMDB page in a WebView at the press of a button.
The UI is constructed out of fragments that respond intelligently to the orientation of the screen. 
The app also communicates with two other Android applications using broadcast receivers, ordered intents, and custom permissions. 

The first and second app request permissions and create broadcast receivers, while the third app contains the main functionality.
